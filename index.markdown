# Workshop Description

Generative AI technologies have introduced a paradigm shift in machine learning and are rapidly being adopted by consumers and enterprises alike. Consumer applications like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney are making access to these technologies widely available and have fueled the rapid commercialization of generative AI. At the same time, generative models have enabled a radically new way for people to interact with computing technology by allowing them to specify what they want rather than how it should be produced. Users are able to create specifications of the kinds of outputs they desire in natural language, through sketches and gestures, novel UI controls or other means. In a recent article, Nielsen called this form of interaction intent-based outcome specification. He argues that it is the first new interaction paradigm in 60 years, fundamentally different from batch processing and command-based interaction. Intent-based outcome specification shifts control over how computation is performed from the user towards the generative AI models, enabling new forms of co-creativity and co-creation while also creating new challenges of how to best support users with creating outcome specifications that yield the desired results and are effective and safe to use.

# Goals
The central questions of our workshop are: How do we design, implement, and evaluate intent-based co-creative experiences that enhance human creativity in their work, play, and education across a range of media types (text, images, audio, code, and video)? How will user needs for creativity support drive the development of generative AI algorithms? How can the capabilities of generative models be leveraged for positive and effective co-creative user experiences? Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners from the domains of HCI & AI to establish a joint community to deepen our understanding of the human-AI co-creative process and to explore the opportunities and challenges of creating meaningful, effective and safe user experiences for intent-based generative systems.

# Submissions

Submissions will take the form of papers & demos (to be published with CEUR) as well as non-archival extended abstracts for our poster session. All submission types should be following CEUR publication guidelines. Please see the [Call for Participation](cfp) for relevant topics and submission instructions.
