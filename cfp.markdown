Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models capable of complex tasks are revolutionizing areas previously considered to define humanity, such as creativity, design, and knowledge work. Research reports that Human-GAI co-creation processes can enhance creativity and even foster a sense of empowerment. A key innovation is the intent-based outcome specification, where users define desired results through natural language, sketches, or gestures, thus shifting control from users to AI models. This paradigm enables new forms of co-creation while presenting challenges in creating effective and safe outcome specifications.

This workshop aims to investigate the design, implementation, and evaluation of intent-based co-creative experiences that boost human creativity in work, play, and education across text, images, audio, code, and video. Key questions focus on how creativity support can guide generative AI development and how to leverage generative models for positive user experiences. By uniting researchers and practitioners from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI, the workshop seeks to deepen understanding of human-AI co-creative interactions and explore opportunities and challenges in developing meaningful and safe generative systems. 

The central questions of our workshop are:

- How do we design, implement, and evaluate intent-based co-creative experiences that enhance human creativity in work, play, and education across a range of media types (text, images, audio, code, and video)? 
- How will user needs for creativity-support drive the development of generative AI algorithms? 
- How can the capabilities of generative models be leveraged for positive and effective co-creative user experiences?

The goal of our workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from the domains of HCI & AI to establish a joint community to deepen our understanding of the human-AI co-creative process and to explore the opportunities and challenges of creating meaningful, effective and safe user experiences for intent-based generative systems. 

Submissions are encouraged, but not limited to, the following topics:

- Novel, AI-augmented user experiences across a range of media types (text, images, audio, code, and video) that support the creation of physical and/or digital artifacts
- Novel ways for creating, managing, and interacting with outcome specifications
- Use cases & novel applications for co-creativity including business use cases
- Techniques, methodologies, & algorithms that enable new user experiences and interactions with generative models and allow for directed and purposeful manipulation of the model output
- Usage patterns, design guidelines, and design principles for intent-based outcome specification that support effective and safe use
- Issues of governance, privacy, and ownership of AI-generated or human-AI co-created content
- Security, including forensic tools and approaches for deep fake detection
- Evaluations of human-AI co-creative processes and quality metrics of AI-generated or human-AI co-created content
- User research on needs & algorithmic requirements for co-creative systems, perceptions of human-AI co-creative systems, trust of co-creative tools & artifacts, and/or implications for HCI theories
- Lessons learned from computational art & design and generative design, and how these impact research
- Potential risks and harms of working with generative models and generated content, and strategies to detect or mitigate those harms

### New in 2025: Spotlight Topic on Agents & Agency in Human-AI Co-Creation

We further call for papers on the following **Spotlight Topic: Agents & Agency in Human-AI Co-Creation**. Agency is the capability of acting independently and exerting power or authority. Recent advances in agentic AI have pushed generative AI beyond mere inference with textual prompts. Instead, AI agents can now perform complex tasks autonomously through (rudimentary) planning and tool use. For example, LLM-based AI agents can [fully control a computer via its (human) user interface](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/23/claude-ai-can-now-control-your-computer-screen-keyboard-and-cursor/), and AI software engineering agents can [turn GitHub issues into pull requests](https://www.swebench.com), entirely without human intervention. What are the implications of such independently-operating agents on human agency?

We seek the community’s insights into the role of agency in human-AI co-creative systems. For example:

- **Enhancing Human Agency**. How can AI be designed to enhance human agency rather than supplant it? What features or interaction designs support human agency by making the AI a collaborator rather than a controller?
- **Conceptualizing Agency**. How can we define and differentiate "agency" when applied to AI versus humans? How do perceptions of agency in AI affect user trust and reliance?
- **Ethical and Societal Implications**. What ethical frameworks are best suited for managing the balance between AI and human agency? In situations where AI has apparent "agency," who is ultimately accountable for decisions, particularly when outcomes are adverse?
- **Agency and Collaboration**. What interaction designs facilitate a collaborative sense of agency between humans and AI? How does shared agency between AI and human teams evolve over time with increased interaction?

# Submission & Review

All papers will undergo a single-blind peer review (i.e. author names and affiliations should be listed). If accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present the work.

A workshop summary will be included in the ACM Digital Library for IUI 2025. Although papers and demos are not part of the archival ACM IUI proceedings, the papers and demos accepted at IUI workshops 2025 will be published in common proceedings via CEUR-WS (see [https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3660/](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3660/) for last year’s workshop proceedings). 

## Papers & Demos

Please follow the CEUR guidelines for the single column paper template ([download the CEUR template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F9Nllrmhu6gUuYDdl-svxqwd5AW5NmZY/view)). The length should be no less than 5 pages for papers and demos, and no more than 10 maximum to be published in CEUR (see [https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html](https://ceur-ws.org/HOWTOSUBMIT.html) for details).

## Posters

We also encourage submissions of non-archival, extended abstracts for our poster session. Note that those abstracts will not be published in CEUR. The length should be two pages and follow the same CEUR guidelines outlined above.

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your papers, demos, and poster abstracts to EasyChair by January 22, 2025:
[https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=haigen2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=haigen2025)

*As part of making a submission, all authors will be asked to provide a short position statement on Agents & Agency in Human-AI Co-Creation, even if their submitted work is not about the spotlight topic.*
