            <h3>Hybrid and Affective Interactions in the GenAI-XR Convergence</h3>
            <p>The convergence of Extended Reality (XR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping digital interactions, with Generative AI-powered embodied conversational agents playing an increasing role in social virtual environments. This keynote explores the intersection of these technologies through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating field studies of emerging social practices in VR, experimental research on affective interactions, and critical reflections on the psychological risks posed by AI-driven XR experiences.</p>
            <p>Drawing upon recent studies, this talk examines the emerging cultures and behaviors in Social VR, including social drinking in virtual spaces, the phenomenon of self-imposed muteness, phantom touch sensations, and the evolving norms around blocking and moderation. These organically developed behaviors are contrasted with controlled experimental studies that investigate the emotional impact of interacting with AI-driven avatars, where factors such as facial expressions, nonverbal cues, and haptic feedback shape user affect and behavior.</p>
            <p>This talk will also explore the psychological risks and ethical concerns at the intersection of AI and XR. The increasing sophistication of AI-powered agents raises questions about emotional manipulation, social influence, and the potential for reinforcing or mitigating toxic behaviors in virtual spaces. We will delve into how these technologies can both enhance social experiences and pose challenges related to mental well-being, identity formation, and online community dynamics.</p>
            <p>By reconciling qualitative fieldwork from real-world Social VR practices with quantitative controlled experiments on affective interaction, this keynote will offer a nuanced perspective on the emotional and cognitive dimensions of AI-driven virtual interactions. Attendees will gain insights into how the design of AI-enhanced avatars and virtual environments can foster inclusive, engaging, and ethical virtual communities while mitigating potential psychological risks. The session will conclude with reflections on future research directions and the responsible development of AI-powered XR experiences.</p>
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Giulio Jacucci, Ph.D., is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki. Previously, he was a Professor in the Department of Design at Aalto University (2009–2010). In 2024, he served as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Macau. He has served multiple times as a subcommittee chair at ACM CHI and is a Senior Editor for The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies. His research contributions span intent modeling and visualization for exploratory search, entity-based personal models derived from screen monitoring, end-user programming for ubiquitous computing, neuroadaptive and affective systems, and sensor-based behavior change. He has chaired ACM IUI (a joint conference of SIGAI and SIGCHI) and is a member of its steering committee. Additionally, he serves as Vice Chair of the Faculty Council and Director of the Master’s Program in Data Science at the University of Helsinki. His current research focuses on affective interaction in extended reality. Prof. Jacucci is also a co-founder of several research spin-offs and a co-inventor of two patents in the fields of information seeking and modular screen technology.</p>

            <h3>Human-AI Interactions: A Multisensory Perspective</h3>
            <p>As digital technology advances, the ways we interact with digital systems are expanding beyond traditional sight and touch. This talk introduces the concept of multisensory experiences, where a variety of senses—including touch, smell, and even taste—are integrated to enhance digital interactions. Using different scenarios, including human-AI interactions, I will provide a flavour of the exciting possibilities these novel interfaces and experiences present. The talk will touch on both the opportunities and challenges in designing for multisensory interaction, offering a glimpse into how these innovations can make digital experiences more immersive, engaging, and accessible.</p>
            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Marianna Obrist is a Professor of Multisensory Interfaces at UCL and Deputy Director of Digital Health at the UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering. Her pioneering research integrates touch, taste, and smell in human-computer interaction, with applications ranging from VR to healthcare. She co-founded and Chief Scientific Officer of OWidgets LtD (OW Smell Made Digital), a university spin-out developing innovative digital scent technology. Her recent projects include the EPSRC/NIHR Smell Care project, which extends previous ERC PoC award research into digital smell training solutions. Additionally, she contributes to the EU FET Touchless.AI project on novel touchless interfaces for social interaction and the UKRI TCC - Textile Circularity Centre, led by RCA, on immersive multisensory textile experiences. Marianna has published over 100 articles in high-impact journals and premier HCI conferences. An overview of her work is featured in the popular science book <em>Multisensory Experiences: Where the Senses Meet Technology</em> by Oxford University Press.</p>
